# UART-Verilog

Implemented the Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter using Verilog-HDL  

Simulated it in Modelsim using the separate testbench file and generated the Netlist and Finite State Machines using Quartus  

Created three modules for implementing the design- Transmitter containing the codes for transmitting the data, Receiver for receiving the data  
and a Top level module to provide the connection and fuctional logic between transmitter and receiver  

Added all the netlists of different modules and simulation waveforms.
